内核代码或驱动代码的TDD, 其实就是类似于嵌入式自动化单元测试, 参考:

系列文章, 目前使用CMocka框架. 可以发现libssh, openvpn, samba等开源软件也使用了这个框架, 详细的测试代码可以进行参考.

要想实现真正的对内核模块做单元测试, 目前使用的工具是

autotest: https://github.com/autotest/autotest

**LTP**: https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp

> **The Linux Test Project (LTP)** delivers test suites to the open source community that validate the reliability and stability of Linux. The LTP test suite contains a collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features. <https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp>
>
> **Autotest** -- a framework for fully automated testing. It is designed primarily to test the Linux kernel, though it is useful for many other purposes such as qualifying new hardware, virtualization testing, and other general user space program testing under Linux platforms. It's an open-source project under the GPL and is used and developed by a number of organizations, including Google, IBM, Red Hat, and many others. <http://autotest.github.io/>
>
> Also there are certification systems developed by some major GNU/Linux distribution companies. These systems usually check complete GNU/Linux distributions for compatibility with hardware. There are certification systems developed by **Novell, Red Hat, Oracle, Canonical, Google**.
>
> There are also systems for dynamic analysis of Linux kernel:
>
> **Kmemleak** is a memory leak detector included in the Linux kernel. It provides a way of detecting possible kernel memory leaks in a way similar to a tracing garbage collector with the difference that the orphan objects are not freed but only reported via /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak.
>
> **Kmemcheck** traps every read and write to memory that was allocated dynamically (i.e. with kmalloc()). If a memory address is read that has not previously been written to, a message is printed to the kernel log. Also is a part of Linux Kernel
>
> **Fault Injection Framework** (included in Linux kernel) allows for infusing errors and exceptions into an application's logic to achieve a higher coverage and fault tolerance of the system.

另外也有出现一些新的框架如下, 需要进行调研:
