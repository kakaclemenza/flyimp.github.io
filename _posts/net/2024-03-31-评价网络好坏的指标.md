### 主要指标

评判网络质量指标一般只有三个:

* 往返延迟rtt
* 抖动jitter
* 丢包率pktloss

如果要将这三个指标结合成一个类似"权重"的数值, 目前有一个通用的计算方式, 即MOS值, 其计算比较复杂, 有需要再专门了解.

各指标的判定数值范围如下:

This stability test aims to check the following factors of your network:

- Packet Loss Rate
- Round Trip Time
- Jitter Delay
- Call quality estimation

**Call Quality Estimation**:
Overall estimated call quality score based on the packet loss rate, round trip time and jitter.
4.5: Excellent (Imperceptible)
4.0: Good (Perceptible but not annoying)
3.0: Fair (Slightly annoying)
2.0: Poor (Annoying)
1.0: Bad (Very Annoying) 

**Packet Loss Rate(%)**:
Packet loss happens when a packet does not arrive, arrives out of order, or arrives too late.
\> 10.0: Might cause frozen video and broken audio.
\>= 2.0: Might cause low video fps, and audio quality might be affected.
< 2.0: Video/Audio quality will not be affected. 

**Average Round Trip Time(ms)**:
Time it took to send a packet to server then receive it back.
\> 300: Might cause unnatural delays in an audio conversation and disconnect between audio and video.

**Average Jitter(ms)**:
Inconsistent arrival of packets between two endpoints.
\> 50: Might cause certain packets of information to drop or sent out of order, leading to a jumbled conversation.
